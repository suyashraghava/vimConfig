# vimConfig

When I started with Vim years ago I wanted it look cool. So I just copied the .vimrc file of someone who is considered as a cool guy, though I don't even remember his name now. Anyways, with time I kept editing this file according to my own needs as I became more experienced in Vim.

Some day I will clean it all up and create my own exclusive file. It will happen and on that day this world will be a beautiful place to live.
